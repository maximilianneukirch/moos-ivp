alogview - further investigate how to automatically detect when there are
no NAV_X/Y components for a contact, and instead draw from VIEW_VESSEL. Currently
it seems we are drawing two vessels by default, and would need to use -nvv to
shut off the second vessel

In drawing the vessels (from the normal means) in pMarineViewer, can we make note
of which vessels were draw and ignore any other VIEW_VESSEL objects with the same
name?


Files that have been alogclipped are sometimes buggy in that they open
in alogview with empty plots.

Seems like in ALogDataBroker, somehow the logtmax is not set right?
invokes "break" immediately

cout << "d_tstamp:" << doubleToString(d_tstamp,2) << endl;
    cout << "m_logskew[aix]:" << doubleToString(m_logskew[aix],2) << endl;
    cout << "m_pruned_logtmax:" << doubleToString(m_pruned_logtmax,2) << endl;

    double dval = d_tstamp + m_logskew[aix];
    cout << "dval:" << doubleToString(dval) << endl;
    
    if((d_tstamp + m_logskew[aix]) < m_pruned_logtmin)
      continue;
    if((d_tstamp + m_logskew[aix]) > m_pruned_logtmax)
      break;
